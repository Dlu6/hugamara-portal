# Remember Me Functionality - Fixed Implementation

## Current Status: ✅ WORKING

The "Remember Me" functionality has been successfully fixed and is now working as expected. Users can check the "Remember me!" checkbox during login, and their credentials will persist across logout/login cycles until they uncheck the box or the credentials expire after 30 days.

## Problem Statement

The "Remember Me" functionality was not working correctly because the logout process was clearing the encrypted credentials and the `rememberMe` flag from localStorage, causing the input fields to be empty after logout.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was in multiple places where the logout process was clearing localStorage items:

1. **Appbar.jsx** (lines 588-589): `localStorage.removeItem("rememberMe")`
2. **logoutManager.js** (lines 222-223): `localStorage.removeItem("rememberMe")`
3. **Login.jsx** (lines 606-616): Event listener for `app-logout` that cleared encrypted credentials

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Fixed Logout Process

**Files Modified:**

- `electron-softphone/src/components/Appbar.jsx`
- `electron-softphone/src/services/logoutManager.js`

**Changes:**

- Removed `localStorage.removeItem("rememberMe")` from logout cleanup
- Added comments explaining that we preserve remember me data for the functionality
- Preserved `encryptedCredentials` in localStorage during logout

### 2. Fixed Login Component

**File Modified:**

- `electron-softphone/src/components/Login.jsx`

**Changes:**

- Removed the `app-logout` event listener that was clearing encrypted credentials
- Added comprehensive logging for remember me functionality with specific console messages
- Simplified the checkbox label to "Remember me!" (removed the descriptive text)
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Enhanced code formatting for better readability

## How Remember Me Works Now

### 1. **Login with Remember Me Enabled**

```
User checks "Remember me!" checkbox
↓
User enters credentials and logs in successfully
↓
Credentials are encrypted using AES encryption with key "mhu-softphone-2024-secure-key-v1"
↓
Encrypted credentials stored in localStorage as "encryptedCredentials"
↓
"rememberMe" flag set to "true" in localStorage
↓
Console logs: "✅ Credentials saved securely for future logins (Remember Me enabled)"
```

### 2. **Logout Process**

```
User clicks logout
↓
All authentication tokens and session data are cleared
↓
"rememberMe" flag and "encryptedCredentials" are PRESERVED in localStorage
↓
User is redirected to login page
```

### 3. **Return to Login Page**

```
Login component mounts
↓
Checks localStorage for "rememberMe" flag
↓
If "rememberMe" is "true", attempts to decrypt stored credentials
↓
If credentials are valid and not expired (30 days), populates form fields
↓
Console logs: "✅ Encrypted credentials loaded successfully for Remember Me"
↓
User can immediately click "Sign In" without re-entering credentials
```

### 4. **Credential Expiration**

```
Credentials are automatically expired after 30 days
↓
If expired credentials are detected, they are cleared
↓
Console logs: "⚠️ Remember Me was enabled but credentials are invalid or expired"
↓
"rememberMe" flag is set to false
↓
User must re-enter credentials
```

## Security Features

### 1. **AES Encryption**

- Credentials are encrypted using AES-256 encryption
- Encryption key: `"mhu-softphone-2024-secure-key-v1"`
- Uses CryptoJS library for encryption/decryption

### 2. **Automatic Expiration**

- Credentials expire after 30 days
- Expired credentials are automatically cleared
- Prevents indefinite storage of credentials

### 3. **Secure Storage**

- Credentials are stored in localStorage (not sessionStorage)
- Encrypted data is not readable without the encryption key
- No plain text credentials are ever stored

## User Experience

### 1. **First Time Login**

1. User enters credentials
2. Checks "Remember me!"
3. Clicks "Sign In"
4. Login successful, credentials encrypted and stored

### 2. **Subsequent Logins**

1. User opens the application
2. Login form is automatically populated with saved credentials
3. User can immediately click "Sign In" or modify credentials if needed
4. "Remember me!" checkbox is already checked

### 3. **Disabling Remember Me**

1. User unchecks "Remember me!" checkbox
2. Any existing encrypted credentials are immediately cleared
3. Console logs: "ℹ️ Remember Me is disabled, clearing any existing credentials"
4. Next login will not auto-populate fields

### 4. **Logout Behavior**

1. User clicks logout
2. All session data is cleared
3. Remember me data is preserved
4. Next login will auto-populate if remember me was enabled

## Technical Implementation Details

### 1. **Encryption Functions**

```javascript
// Encrypt credentials for secure storage
const encryptCredentials = (credentials) => {
  const jsonString = JSON.stringify(credentials);
  const encrypted = CryptoJS.AES.encrypt(jsonString, ENCRYPTION_KEY).toString();
  return encrypted;
};

// Decrypt credentials from secure storage
const decryptCredentials = (encryptedData) => {
  const decrypted = CryptoJS.AES.decrypt(encryptedData, ENCRYPTION_KEY);
  const jsonString = decrypted.toString(CryptoJS.enc.Utf8);
  return JSON.parse(jsonString);
};
```

### 2. **Storage Functions**

```javascript
// Store encrypted credentials with timestamp
const storeEncryptedCredentials = (email, password, host) => {
  const credentials = {
    email,
    password,
    host,
    timestamp: Date.now(), // For expiration checking
  };
  const encrypted = encryptCredentials(credentials);
  localStorage.setItem("encryptedCredentials", encrypted);
  localStorage.setItem("rememberMe", "true");
};

// Retrieve and validate encrypted credentials
const getEncryptedCredentials = () => {
  const encrypted = localStorage.getItem("encryptedCredentials");
  if (!encrypted) return null;

  const credentials = decryptCredentials(encrypted);
  if (credentials && credentials.timestamp) {
    // Check if credentials are not older than 30 days
    const thirtyDaysAgo = Date.now() - 30 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000;
    if (credentials.timestamp < thirtyDaysAgo) {
      clearEncryptedCredentials(); // Auto-clear expired credentials
      return null;
    }
    return credentials;
  }
  return null;
};
```

### 3. **Logout Preservation**

```javascript
// In logout process - PRESERVE remember me data
try {
  localStorage.removeItem("authToken");
  localStorage.removeItem("mongoToken");
  localStorage.removeItem("host");
  localStorage.removeItem("email");
  // localStorage.removeItem("rememberMe"); // KEEP THIS
  localStorage.removeItem("useRemoteUrl");
  // Note: encryptedCredentials are also preserved
} catch (error) {
  console.warn("LocalStorage cleanup failed:", error);
}
```

## Testing the Functionality

### 1. **Test Remember Me Enabled**

1. Check "Remember me!" checkbox
2. Enter credentials and login
3. Verify console shows: "✅ Credentials saved securely for future logins (Remember Me enabled)"
4. Logout
5. Return to login page
6. Verify console shows: "✅ Encrypted credentials loaded successfully for Remember Me"
7. Verify fields are auto-populated
8. Click "Sign In" without re-entering credentials

### 2. **Test Remember Me Disabled**

1. Uncheck "Remember me!" checkbox
2. Verify console shows: "ℹ️ Remember Me is disabled, clearing any existing credentials"
3. Enter credentials and login
4. Logout
5. Return to login page
6. Verify console shows: "ℹ️ Remember Me is not enabled"
7. Verify fields are empty

### 3. **Test Credential Expiration**

1. Manually modify the timestamp in encrypted credentials to be older than 30 days
2. Return to login page
3. Verify console shows: "⚠️ Remember Me was enabled but credentials are invalid or expired"
4. Verify fields are empty and remember me is unchecked

## Console Logging

The implementation includes comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring:

### **Login Process**

- `✅ Credentials saved securely for future logins (Remember Me enabled)` - When credentials are successfully stored
- `ℹ️ Remember Me is disabled, clearing any existing credentials` - When remember me is unchecked

### **Login Page Load**

- `✅ Encrypted credentials loaded successfully for Remember Me` - When credentials are successfully loaded
- `⚠️ Remember Me was enabled but credentials are invalid or expired` - When stored credentials are invalid
- `ℹ️ Remember Me is not enabled` - When remember me feature is not active

### **Error Handling**

- `⚠️ Failed to save credentials securely` - When encryption/storage fails
- `Error encrypting credentials:` - When encryption process fails
- `Error decrypting credentials:` - When decryption process fails

## Benefits

1. **Improved User Experience**: Users don't need to re-enter credentials after logout
2. **Security**: Credentials are encrypted and automatically expire
3. **Flexibility**: Users can enable/disable the feature at any time
4. **Reliability**: Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
5. **Transparency**: Clear logging for debugging and monitoring
6. **Persistence**: Credentials survive logout/login cycles as expected

# Attended Transfer Implementation Summary

## âœ… Successfully Implemented

The attended (managed) transfer functionality has been successfully implemented using pure SIP.js without any AMI dependencies.

## What Was Done

### 1. **Replaced AMI-based Implementation**

- Removed all AMI API calls from `attendedTransfer()`, `completeAttendedTransfer()`, and `cancelAttendedTransfer()`
- Implemented pure SIP.js solution using REFER with Replaces header

### 2. **Key Implementation Details**

#### Starting Attended Transfer

```javascript
attendedTransfer(targetExtension);
```

- Holds the original call
- Creates a new consultation call using SIP.js Inviter
- Stores both original and consultation sessions
- Switches audio to consultation call

#### Completing Transfer

```javascript
completeAttendedTransfer();
```

- Builds Replaces header from consultation dialog
- Sends REFER with Replaces to original session
- Ends consultation call
- Clears all state

#### Cancelling Transfer

```javascript
cancelAttendedTransfer();
```

- Ends consultation call
- Returns to original call
- Unholds original call
- Restores audio

### 3. **Technical Details**

**Replaces Header Format:**

```
Replaces=callId;to-tag=toTag;from-tag=fromTag
```

**REFER-TO URI Format:**

```
<sip:extension@domain?Replaces=encoded_replaces_value>
```

### 4. **Event Emissions**

The implementation emits proper events for UI updates:

- `call:attended_transfer_started`
- `transfer:consultation_ringing`
- `transfer:consultation_established`
- `transfer:consultation_failed`
- `transfer:managed_completed`
- `transfer:managed_cancelled`

## Testing Instructions

### Test Scenario: Attended Transfer

1. **Setup**: Extension 1015 calls 1010
2. **Answer**: 1010 answers the call
3. **Initiate**: From 1010, start attended transfer to 1008
4. **Consultation**:
   - 1008 rings and answers
   - 1010 can talk to 1008 (1015 is on hold)
5. **Complete**:
   - 1010 clicks "Complete Transfer"
   - 1015 and 1008 are connected
   - 1010 is disconnected

### Alternative: Cancel Transfer

At step 5, instead of completing:

- 1010 clicks "Cancel Transfer"
- Returns to call with 1015
- 1008 consultation call ends

## Benefits Over AMI Implementation

1. **No Server Dependencies**: Works directly through SIP protocol
2. **Better Performance**: No API round trips
3. **More Reliable**: Direct SIP signaling
4. **Cleaner Code**: All transfer logic in one place
5. **Standard Compliant**: Uses standard SIP REFER with Replaces

## Important Notes

- Both blind and attended transfers now use pure SIP.js
- No AMI dependencies remain in the transfer system
- The implementation follows SIP standards (RFC 3891 - Replaces header)
- Proper error handling and recovery mechanisms in place

The attended transfer implementation is now complete and ready for testing!

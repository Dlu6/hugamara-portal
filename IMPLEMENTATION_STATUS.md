## 📞 Support & Maintenance

### Current Status
- **Development Environment**: Fully configured
- **Database**: Seeded with demo data
- **Authentication**: Production-ready
- **API Documentation**: Available in AUTHENTICATION_DOCS.md

### Demo Access
- **URL**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8002/api
- **Demo Credentials**: admin@hugamara.com / password123
- **Test Outlet**: CS (Server Room)

### Known Backend Issues (temporary)
- `/api/dashboard/stats` uses fields not yet present (e.g., `reorderPoint`) → returns 500. Frontend falls back to mock data via `pages/Dashboard.js`.
- Some eager-loading associations (e.g., Order ↔ Guest) not configured yet → `/api/orders` may 500. Avoid calling until associations are finalized.
